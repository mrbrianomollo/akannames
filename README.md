- This website was inspired by how the Akan tribe from Ghana determine their new-born's first name.

The website outputs the Akan name depending on gender and DOB.

## BDD

> You will be required to fill out the the DOB form and gender.
> The website will calculate the day depending on the details you input and will output the name that is associated with the specific day.

- NB : `All input should be Numbers`
